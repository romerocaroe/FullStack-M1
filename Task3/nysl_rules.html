                        <li><p>DIMENSIONS.</p>FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</li>
                        <li><p>COMPETITION FIELDS.</p>Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away</li>

Match officials shall be empowered to enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials to comply with these standards.</li>
